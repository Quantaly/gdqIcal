# gdqIcal
An unofficial [iCalendar](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545) generator for the [Games Done Quick](https://gamesdonequick.com/) schedule.

The preferred avenue of consumption is through the [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=vigfoclhm409ckf3h1p762l2hv5og4cn%40import.calendar.google.com), but it also runs on [Heroku](https://gdq-schedule-ical.herokuapp.com/out.ics).
