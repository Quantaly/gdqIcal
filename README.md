**NO LONGER ACTIVE: Since [Heroku's free tier of service is ending](https://blog.heroku.com/next-chapter), this has been superseded by [gdq-ical-cf-worker](https://github.com/Quantaly/gdq-ical-cf-worker), which (as the name suggests) is designed to run on on [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).**

An unofficial [iCalendar](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545) generator for the [Games Done Quick](https://gamesdonequick.com/) schedule.

The preferred avenue of consumption ~~is~~ was through the [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=vigfoclhm409ckf3h1p762l2hv5og4cn%40import.calendar.google.com), but it also ~~runs~~ ran on [Heroku](https://gdq-schedule-ical.herokuapp.com/out.ics).
